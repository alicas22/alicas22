# Hey there! 
I'm Anton, a software developer with a background in mortgage and software sales. I've always been fascinated by problem-solving and innovation, which is why I pursued a degree in Biomedical Engineering. However, I realized that my passion lies in the dynamic and ever-changing world of technology, which led me to become a software engineer. With my diverse experiences and love for learning, I'm excited to continue growing and tackling new challenges in this field.
